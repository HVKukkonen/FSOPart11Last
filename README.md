# christmas-wish-list
I built a Christmas wish list web application for personal use last December. But over the Christmas holidays I got the idea that it would be fun to try out developing it further into a publicly useable – although bare bones – application. The application is written in JavaScript using Node.js and React. I use MongoDB Atlas for data storage and Heroku to host the service. The application handles identity management enabling users to create wish lists and invite friends that see and can claim these wishes.

The service is running at: http://christmas-wish-list.herokuapp.com/ (given I have still capacity left on my free Heroku dyno...)
