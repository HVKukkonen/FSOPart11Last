# [Full Stack Open 2021](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

This repository contains my solution to the last exercise of the part 11 of the Full Stack Open (2021) course by the University of Helsinki. The rest of the exercises for part 11 can be found [here](https://github.com/HVKukkonen/full-stack-open-pokedex).

This exercise is a modification of my personal project. In this exercise I implement a continuous integration workflow using Github Actions and Heroku auto-deployment. The deployment pipeline contains automated version tagging as well as end-to-end testing. The deployed application can be found [here](http://christmas-wish-list.herokuapp.com).
